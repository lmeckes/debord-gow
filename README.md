Game of War incorporates the problems of conflict in general within a manageable framework. Debord’s ambition seems to be no less than to create a game with possibilities for play that are as great as chess but which conceives of play in a different manner. That one’s communication must remain intact is equivalent to the rule in chess that the king must not remain in check. Debord includes in his presentation of the game a line from the 1527 poem “Scacchia Ludus” by Marcus Hieronymus. The opening lines of the poem are: “We play an effigy of war, and battles made like / real ones, armies formed from boxwood, and play realms, / As twin kings, white and black, opposed against each other, / Struggle for praise with bi-colored weapons.”9 That strategic genius, in any field, is the only thing worth commemorating is a characteristically Debordian note. Effigy is a word that might appeal to Debord in its modern sense (as in ”burn in effigy”), given how careful he was to preserve his bad reputation.10 But here it might mean something else: that the game is a form, a mold—an allegory, perhaps—for a certain kind of strategic experience.
